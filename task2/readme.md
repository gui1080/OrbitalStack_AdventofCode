### Problem

As the task describes a new strategy, the following statement is not consistent:

```
In the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (A), and you need the round to end in a draw (Y), so you also choose Rock. This gives you a score of 1 + 3 = 4.
```

Previously, "Y" was Paper and not Rock ("X").

I'll be developing the code for the new strategy based on the following statement:

```
"Anyway, the second column says how the round needs to end: X means you need to lose, Y means you need to end the round in a draw, and Z means you need to win. Good luck!"
```
