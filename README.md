I did not know if the first few tasks were easier or not, so I picked some tasks to do at random from the home page.

I used Python to solve the tasks as it was told to me that it would be important in the work environment.

## How to run my code!

For every task, the input is a *input.txt* file. 

At a task directory, run:

> python3 main.py

### Dependencies

Python 3.11.2

#### Numpy

> pip3 install numpy
